# Stock-Calendar-Bot

I build this because of this video originally [Best Options Strategy We've Ever Used! | Matt Choi, CMT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHnQMTl5jkQ), but the video now has been marked private. 

Here is others videos that provide about the same idea of the original video:

#### Disclaimer: I am not clamming that I know the formula used in Matt Choi program, nor is this meant to give finacial advice. This is more only out of interest of data mining and data analisist.



I went to this website to obtain the list of stocks names in the US [gurufocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock_list.php).

When it was time to download the data I put the range for about 10 years back of data.
If I ran into problems with obtaining data the job of the bot was to skip that stock.

After all of that I was left with a smaller list of stocks to work with.
Totaling around 7,083 stocks as seen in the [data/raw folder](https://github.com/mymggithub/Stock-Calendar-Bot/tree/main/data/raw)
